Hi,<br>
<br>
I run Computer Whiz Canberra as a side-line to my regular job. 
I help people with malware infections, data retrieval, setting up wireless at home and pretty much anything a home-user's PC can throw at me.
I often sell new computers; generally desktops, but I can also source laptops. I do onsite visits, generally weeknights or weekends.<br>
<br>
You can contact me <a href="contact.php">here</a>, or using the details below:
<ul class="list">
<li><a href="mailto:web@computerwhiz.com.au">web@computerwhiz.com.au</a></li>
<li>02 6112 8025</li>
</ul>
<br>
Thanks for visiting the site. If you have a question, let me know - I'd love to help.<br>
<Br>
Sincerely,<br>
<br>
Derek Gillett
