				Hi! My name is Derek Gillett and I run Computer Whiz Canberra from my home in Kambah, ACT.<Br>
				<Br>
				My goal is to save people the stress and frustration that can so often be caused by a misbehaving
				computer. It might be important data that you seem to have lost,
				strange messages that you are worried about, popup advertising or more sinister threats to the
				safety of your personal information, or any other annoyance / concern that
				your computer is causing you to have.<br>
				<Br>
				A sample of some areas that I regularly help people with include:
			</p>
			<ul class="list">
				<li class="first"><a href="#">Removal of malware / spyware / viruses and other nasties</a></li>
				<li><a href="#">Hardware repairs - e.g. computer won't start</a></li>
				<li><a href="#">New computer setup including transfer of data from your old PC</a></li>
				<li><a href="#">Computer sales and repair service</a></li>
				<li class="last"><a href="#">PC health checks</a></li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				This is a part-time business for me, which means I can't take calls during the day.
				But you can still have me come out by using my
				<a target='_blank' href="http://computerwhiz.simplybook.me">bookings website</a>.
				Once you book, both you and I will receive an email confirmation. Don't worry, if you
				change your mind or need to reschedule, just contact me and we can arrange it.<br>
				<br>

				If you'd prefer to chat first, the best way to contact me is via
				<a href='mailto:web@computerwhiz.com.au'>email</a>. Just leave your name, contact
				number, and the best time to call, and I'll get back to you ASAP.<br>
				<Br>
				If you have booked an appointment, I'd appreciate it if you could fill out
