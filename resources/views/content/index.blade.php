        Hi, I'm Derek Gillett and I run Computer Whiz - Canberra. This is my own small business which I've run
        from my home since 2009. I previously ran a similar business in Brisbane before moving to Canberra.<br />
        <br />
        I'm passionate about all things I.T. My aim is to provide expert technical advice and assistance
        in a friendly, easy-to-understand manner to the local community.<br />
        <br />
        I currently run this business part-time when not at my full-time job, so I'm usually available weeknights
        and weekends.<br />
        <br />

    <h2>Pricing</h2>
    <p>
        Computer Whiz pricing is super simple - $120/hr with a minimum 1 hour, then charged in 15min increments after that.
        I'm also happy to provide remote support, in which case there's no minimum.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you decide to book online, you can also pay with a credit card. Otherwise, I'll happily accept cash,
        or bank deposit on the day.
    </p>
